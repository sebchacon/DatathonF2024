# DatathonF2024

## Sebastian Chacon and Julian Cabrerra achieved 1st Place representing Traders@SMU

The Datathon was a 20 hour simulation challenge in which each team is tasked as "Consultants" for XYZ Company to present a thorough Trend Analysis, Abnormality Detetcion, and pitch actionable insights (via Proof of Concept) for a new product using Health and Fitness datasets. Myself along with Julian Cabrerra presented "NightHorse Tracker", a new health watch tracker utilizing two Machine Learning models to gather and interpret health metrics such as calorie intake, steps per day, hours of sleep, etc. 

Our models consisted of an Isolation Forest which found abnormalities in our data allowing us to plot a boundary curve for non-linear outliers in our data paired with a Gradient Booster, taking 6 inputs to build "profiles" around the trends in people who develop sleep disorders such as AFIB, Sleep Apnea, and Insomnia. Utilizing these models we can ping users with mild-harsh warnings alerting Users of their negative health habits that could develop sleeping disorders.
